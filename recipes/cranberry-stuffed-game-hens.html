        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you've never worked with game hens before, they're very user-friendly. <br>
            Even stuffed to excess, they only roast for about an hour in a hot oven, <br>
            and as long as you don't overcook them (use a thermometer!), you'll be enjoying the kind of juicy, <br>
            flavorful meat that people cooking turkey only dream of.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups 1/2-inch bread cubes (such as walnut bread)</li>

            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
                
            <li>¼ cup minced shallots</li>
                
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onions</li>
                
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                
            <li>¼ cup dried cranberries</li>
                
            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Spread bread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet.</li><br>
            <li>Toast bread in the preheated oven until golden, crispy, and completely dry, 20 to 40 minutes. Transfer bread to a large bowl.</li><br>
            <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir shallots and green onions with a pinch of <br>
                salt in hot butter until shallots are translucent and soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add dried cranberries to shallots; <br>
                cook and stir until cranberries are warmed through, 2 o 3 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Pour chicken broth into skillet; bring broth mixture to a simmer and pour mixture over dried bread cubes. <br>
                Stir until liquid is absorbed. Season with chopped thyme, minced rosemary, sage, cayenne pepper, salt, <br>
                and black pepper. Mix beaten egg into bread mixture, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let stuffing sit <br>
                until liquid is absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li><br>
            <li>Drizzle the bottom of a roasting pan with 2 tablespoons oil and lay thyme sprigs and rosemary sprigs on the bottom of the pan.</li><br>
            <li>Generously season each hen cavity with salt. Stuff each hen with about 1/2 the bread-cranberry mixture. <br>
                Tie legs together and set into prepared roasting pan on top of thyme and rosemary sprigs. Brush hens with <br>
                remaining olive oil and season with salt and black pepper.</li><br>
            <li>Bake hens in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. <br>
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). <br>
                Remove hens to a platter, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Place roasting pan over medium-high heat. Stir chicken broth, fresh cranberries, and maple syrup into the pan and <br>
                bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. <br>
                Cook and stir until sauce reduces and thickens, 1 to 3 minutes. Spoon sauce over stuffed hens.</li><br>
        </ol>
