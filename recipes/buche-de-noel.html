        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Buche de Noel is the French name for a Christmas cake shaped like a log. <br>
            This one is a heavenly flourless chocolate cake rolled with chocolate whipped cream. <br>
            Traditionally, Buche de Noel is decorated with confectioners' sugar to resemble snow on a Yule log.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>

            <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
                
            <li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                
            <li>6 egg yolks</li>
                
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
                
            <li>⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan with parchment paper. <br>
                In a large bowl, whip cream, 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, 1/2 cup cocoa, and 1 teaspoon vanilla until thick and stiff. Refrigerate.</li><br>
            <li>In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat egg yolks with 1/2 cup sugar until thick and pale. <br>
                Blend in 1/3 cup cocoa, 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla, and salt. In large glass bowl, using clean beaters, <br>
                whip egg whites to soft peaks. Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar, and beat until whites form stiff peaks. <br>
                Immediately fold the yolk mixture into the whites. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.</li><br>
            <li>Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the cake springs back when lightly touched. <br>
                Dust a clean dishtowel with confectioners' sugar. Run a knife around the edge of the pan, and turn the warm cake out onto the towel. <br>
                Remove and discard parchment paper. Starting at the short edge of the cake, roll the cake up with the towel. Cool for 30 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Unroll the cake, and spread the filling to within 1 inch of the edge. Roll the cake up with the filling inside. <br>
                Place seam side down onto a serving plate, and refrigerate until serving. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.</li><br>
        </ol>
