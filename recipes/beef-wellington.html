        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a very easy recipe that I learned when I was living in England. <br>
            Note that Beef Wellington should always be served with the center slightly pink. Enjoy!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ pounds beef tenderloin</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
                
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                
            <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
                
            <li>2 ounces liver pate</li>
                
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place beef in a small baking dish, <br>
                and spread with 2 tablespoons softened butter. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until browned. <br>
                Remove from pan, and allow to cool completely. Reserve pan juices.</li><br>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and mushrooms in butter for 5 minutes. <br>
                Remove from heat, and let cool.</li><br>
            <li>Mix together pate and 2 tablespoons softened butter, and season with salt and pepper. <br>
                Spread pate over beef. Top with onion and mushroom mixture.</li><br>
            <li>Roll out the puff pastry dough, and place beef in the center. Fold up, and seal all the edges,<br>
                 making sure the seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9x13 inch baking dish, cut a few slits <br>
                 in the top of the dough, and brush with egg yolk.</li><br>
            <li>Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) <br>
                for 10 to 15 more minutes, or until pastry is a rich, golden brown. Set aside, and keep warm.</li><br>
            <li>Place all reserved juices in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in beef stock and red wine; <br>
                boil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until slightly reduced. Strain, and serve with beef.</li><br>
        </ol>
